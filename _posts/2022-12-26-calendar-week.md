## What is a week?
A week is seven days. At least, most calendars that are in use today have seven
day weeks. But they do disagree a bit on what is the first day of the week.[^1]
The ISO 8601[^2] standard defines the ISO week date in it with seven day weeks
starting on Monday, followed by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday is the last.[^3]

## What is a year?
A year, or more precisely a solar year[^4] is the time it takes for Earth to
complete one revolution around the Sun. It is also known as a Tropical year, and
is close to 365.25 days. 

Makers of all the calendars that we use today wanted the number of days in a
year to be a whole number. For instance, the Julian Calendar[^5] did this by
having 365 days in a normal year, and having a leap year, with 366 days every
four years. But the 365.25 days is an approximation, so the seasons began to
drift over time as a consequence.

The most popular calendar in use today is called the Gregorian Calendar.[^6] The
Gregorian calendar fixed the drift of seasons in Julian calendar. It does this
by omitting the leap year every one hundred years, like 1100, 1300, 1900, but
not if the year is divisible by 400. This means 1996, 2000, and 2400 are leap
years, but 1997, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not leap years. This makes one average
year 365.2425 days in Gergorian Clendar, which is much closer to the actual
solar year.

## How many weeks are a year?
Having a whole number of weeks per year is a nice thing to have. And a year is
either 365 days or 366 days, neither of which is divisible by seven. Both have
52 whole weeks and either one or two extra days. This means it is impossible to
have a whole number of weeks per year, unless we do some clevar trickery; which
is exactly what the Calendar week does.

## Calendar week
According to the ISO Week date, there is either 52 or 53 full weeks in a year.
The ﬁrst week of a year is the week with the ﬁrst Thursday of that year. 

If the year begins on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, then this is the
first week of that year. This means the first week of a new year can already
start by the 29th of December of the previous year. But if the year begins on a
Friday, Saturday or Sunday, then the first week of that year is only the
following week.

Weeks are numbered from 1 to 52 (or 53 when the there is an extra week). And the
first week of a year is counted as week 1. Using this system, 2021-11-13 can be
written as 2021-W45-6. And this week is simply called "Calendar week 45".
